I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
I'm falling too fast, deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you
'Cause you're the right time

The long-hidden time
Calls us back again
No matter where we are
The end is always you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean

And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see

In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see

And I'd climb every mountainI'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
I'm falling too fast, deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh
I know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
Every night in my bed, I'm dreaming
That it's you in my arms I'm holding
Girl, all I want is you
You know you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going
It's you

The long-hidden time
Calls us back again
No matter where we are
The end is always you

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
I'm falling too fast, deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh
I know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
Every night in my bed, I'm dreaming
That it's you in my arms I'm holding
Girl, all I want is you
You know you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going
It's you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh

[Verse 1]
The long-hidden time
Calls us back again
No matter where we are
The end is always you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all

And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment

You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah

To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh

I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
I'm falling too fast, deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh
I know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
Every night in my bed, I'm dreaming
That it's you in my arms I'm holding
Girl, all I want is you
You know you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going
It's you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh

You (no, no)
It's you (whoa, whoa)
You (it's you, love)
It's you (it's you, yeah, yeah)
You (you)
It's you
[Verse 1]
The long-hidden time
Calls us back again
No matter where we are
The end is always you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug

That you are the reason
[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah

Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
I'm falling too fast, deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh
I know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
Every night in my bed, I'm dreaming
That it's you in my arms I'm holding
Girl, all I want is you
You know you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going
It's you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh
I know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You

You (no, no)
It's you (whoa, whoa)
You (it's you, love)
It's you (it's you, yeah, yeah)
You (you)
It's you
[Verse 1]
The long-hidden time
Calls us back again
No matter where we are
The end is always you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken

And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
I'm falling too fast, deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you

The long-hidden time
Calls us back again
No matter where we are
The end is always you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes

And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
I'm falling too fast, deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh
I know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
Every night in my bed, I'm dreaming
That it's you in my arms I'm holding
Girl, all I want is you
You know you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going
It's you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh
I know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment

You
It's you
You (no, no)
It's you (whoa, whoa)
You (it's you, love)
It's you (it's you, yeah, yeah)
You (you)
It's you
[Verse 1]
The long-hidden time
Calls us back again
No matter where we are
The end is always you

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again

And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
I'm falling too fast, deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh
I know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
Every night in my bed, I'm dreaming
That it's you in my arms I'm holding
Girl, all I want is you
You know you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going
It's you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh

[Verse 1]
The long-hidden time
Calls us back again
No matter where we are
The end is always you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason

I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now

I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason

Oh, 'cause I need you to see

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah

I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
I'm falling too fast, deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh
I know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
Every night in my bed, I'm dreaming
That it's you in my arms I'm holding
Girl, all I want is you
You know you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going
It's you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh

You (no, no)
It's you (whoa, whoa)
You (it's you, love)
It's you (it's you, yeah, yeah)
You (you)

[Verse 1]
The long-hidden time
Calls us back again
No matter where we are
The end is always you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time

'Cause you are the reason

Oh, 'cause I need you to see

There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
I'm falling too fast, deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you

Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
I'm falling too fast, deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh
I know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
Every night in my bed, I'm dreaming
That it's you in my arms I'm holding
Girl, all I want is you
You know you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going
It's you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh
I know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You
It's you
You (no, no)
It's you (whoa, whoa)
You (it's you, love)
It's you (it's you, yeah, yeah)
You (you)
It's you
[Verse 1]
The long-hidden time
Calls us back again
No matter where we are
The end is always you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now

I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see

I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight

I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark

And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah

To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh

And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
I'm falling too fast, deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh
I know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment

Every night in my bed, I'm dreaming
That it's you in my arms I'm holding
Girl, all I want is you
You know you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going
It's you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment

You (no, no)
It's you (whoa, whoa)
You (it's you, love)
It's you (it's you, yeah, yeah)
You (you)
It's you

The long-hidden time
Calls us back again
No matter where we are
The end is always you

I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
I'm falling too fast, deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you

That it's you in my arms I'm holding
Girl, all I want is you
You know you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going
It's you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean

And fix what I've broken

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
I'm falling too fast, deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh
I know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
Every night in my bed, I'm dreaming
That it's you in my arms I'm holding
Girl, all I want is you
You know you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going
It's you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight

It's you (whoa, whoa)
You (it's you, love)

You (you)

[Verse 1]
The long-hidden time
Calls us back again
No matter where we are
The end is always you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
I'm falling too fast, deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you

There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
I'm falling too fast, deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh
I know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
Every night in my bed, I'm dreaming
That it's you in my arms I'm holding
Girl, all I want is you
You know you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going
It's you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh
I know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You

You (no, no)
It's you (whoa, whoa)
You (it's you, love)
It's you (it's you, yeah, yeah)
You (you)
It's you
[Verse 1]
The long-hidden time
Calls us back again
No matter where we are
The end is always you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you

Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment

Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
I'm falling too fast, deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh
I know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
Every night in my bed, I'm dreaming
That it's you in my arms I'm holding
Girl, all I want is you
You know you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going
It's you

[Verse 1]
The long-hidden time
Calls us back again
No matter where we are
The end is always you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
I'm falling too fast, deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you

The long-hidden time
Calls us back again
No matter where we are
The end is always you

I've waited for a long time

That it's you in my arms I'm holding
Girl, all I want is you
You know you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going
It's you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh
I know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You
It's you
You (no, no)
It's you (whoa, whoa)
You (it's you, love)
It's you (it's you, yeah, yeah)
You (you)
It's you
[Verse 1]
The long-hidden time
Calls us back again
No matter where we are
The end is always you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you love
Baby, I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know
Just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause finally it's real
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you
You're the right time
At the right moment
You're the sunlight
Keeps my heart going, whoa
Know when I'm with you
I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
Baby, I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of, yeah
And if I can break enough
To show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have girl just for you, uh oh
I'm tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
I'm falling too fast, deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you
'Cause you're the right time
At the right moment

Keeps my heart going, oh uh oh

I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
Be a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
[Verse 2]
In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you
[Chorus]

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
